## The 2 functions below are used to a)create special matrix object that can 
## cache its inverse and b)compute the inverse of special object created by 
## first function

## Function makeCacheMatrix returns a special matrix object (list of functions)
## that can cache its inverse


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = numeric()) {
    
    
}


## cacheSolve returns inverse of matrix from cache, if available, else computes
## and returns a matrix that is an inverse of 'x'

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

   
}
